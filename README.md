    Terms of use: Use requires the inclusion of links to Source Projects and to this project, and 
    the addition of the cost for end users as determined in Pricing.
    Pricing: This project does not prescribe any rules for the pricing of the use of derivative 
    "end products". The cost of creating this product must be added to the cost of creating derivative 
    products. This added value will be distributed among all derivative products in the proportion of 
    the value of all contributions by the Contributors of the relevant projects, and will be reimbursed 
    according to the rules defined for the reimbursement of the remaining Contributors of these projects. 
    Source Projects used for this project is determine pricing.

## Intro
New principles are described here for managing projects which will be distributed under the [**Coopyright License**](https://github.com/libermans/coopyright-license). The description includes the way the product development should be conducted and financed, and the way the distribution of the produced product should be carried out.

Until the necessary infrastructure becomes available for the effective creation of **Coopyright License** projects, this description proposes to use existing tools such as Github, Ethereum, etc.

## Coopyright Projects creation principles

  1. **Coopyright Project** is a project for developing products to be distributed under the [**Coopyright License**](https://github.com/libermans/coopyright-license). 

  The principles of **Coopyright Project**’s development are in many respects similar to the development of Open Source projects, the main difference being that the participants of the created product will be remunerated by the users of the final product.

  The principle proposed here will allow each consumer to get the created product for the lowest possible price and in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the principle described here is worthwhile primarily for those creators who personally would like to use the manufactured product and are willing to purchase one or more copies of it.

  2. The creation of a **Coopyright Project** can begin with the creation of a Github project to which the original creator (the Author) pushes as the first commit a description of the product that they would like to be created. In the same commit, they publish the Ethereum wallet to collect the necessary funds for developing the tool.

  **Contributors**

  3. The author can invite potential contributors to make a part of the required product.

  4. Those who want to participate (including the Author) in the creation of the product (Contributors) can create a necessary piece of the product, put it in a separate branch and submit a pull request to the head branch. The pushed piece of work should include changes to the finance.me file in the project root, with the addition of the cost of the work done (ideally specifying the detailed classification of this amount, the hours of work and their cost, or payments to third parties) and the Ethereum wallet address to which the payment should be sent. Any cost of work can be indicated, but the size of the requested amount may affect the decision whether to include the piece in the master branch or not. The contributor may additionally provide information confirming the market value of the completed work.

  5. If the Pull request is accepted by the Author, the Contributor will claim compensation for the work done from the funds that will be collected in the project's wallet. The remuneration can begin to be distributed from the collected funds at the completion of the first working version of the product, or as soon as the Pull request is accepted (merged), or once a month. Remuneration from available funds in the project wallet is distributed among all Contributors in the proportion of the cost of their contribution still unpaid, up to the amount of their contribution cost. The Contributor may specify that the condition for including their piece in the Author's branch is that the cost must be paid immediately on inclusion in the branch.

  6. If two or more Contributors produce the same part of the product with good quality, and the Author chooses one of the versions for addition to the head branch, the Author has the right to decide to have another Contributor (or several) remunerated as well, asking them to make their pull request empty, only adding information about payment.

  7. Eventually an end product will be formed in the Github projects, copies of which will either be distributed to users as binary, or launched on a cloud hosting service (AWS), where the users will have access to use it, paying the hosting cost separately.

  **Price and consumers**

  8. The Author defines the model of payment by consumers for copies of the product that will be produced in the framework of this project: whether the consumers will pay for a copy, or pay a percentage of the transaction on the platform created within the project, or pay per copy per month. And whether it is also possible to use the product for free within other free products.

  9. The Author determines the method (and its parameters) of distributing the collected funds between all the Contributors and consumers after the product is ready and after the amount of the collected funds has exceeded the amount spent by all the Contributors.

  10. Basic distribution model: Subsequent consumers receive the product at a lower price, and the money they pay goes back to previous consumers, so that the price for all consumers is made equal. So, for example, if the product is absolutely copyable and the total cost of its creation is $10,000 and 100 people pay $100 for a copy, then person #101 can get a copy for $10,000 / 101 = $99.01, which is divided into 100 parts, and each previous consumer is paid 99 cents. This way the cost for all consumers becomes equal. Also, the model can determine the minimum price fraction after which the cost of further use of the product will become zero, i.e. the product will become the property of mankind.

  11. Other distribution models may imply that the contribution of the Contributors and consumers who prepay early can be evaluated higher to cover the risk factor of such an investment. For example, their contribution can be counted as doubled in volume when allocating funds. However, this additional reward should not be left at a high level, so that it does not become the main motivation for participation (and in this way there would not be a significant reason for creating a clone without reference to the original).

  12. The distribution model can also take into account that if the product being created is not absolutely copyable, i. e. each instance requires additional work (case in point - infrastructure costs for executing the code on cloud services), then the cost of using the copy will decrease only in the part of the cost of the product that is copyable, i.e. the price will aim to match the price of the part that is not copyable (for example, the cost of the infrastructure).

  13. In case the work on the product continues after the release of the working version and some commits are added to the master branch after the launch and after the contributions of all Contributors have been paid for, the price for a copy does not increase because of this, but new payments primarily go to remuneration for new works, after which the cost again begins to strive down.

  14. Until the development of the working version is completed and until the funds collected for development exceed the total contribution of the Contributors, the Author designates the minimum price (or percentage) for which consumers can receive a copy of the product, even before the necessary funds are collected. To determine the price, it is necessary to name the maximum price which in the foreseeable future a sufficient number of people would be willing to pay for the use of the product so as to cover the entire amount of costs. The Author, if they see this as necessary, and provided that the money in the wallet is sufficient, can at any time reduce this price, and in this case the corresponding part of the money immediately returns to users who have made a prepayment).

  15. As proof of their personal interest in the product, the Author can send an advance payment for the use of the future product to the designated wallet, at the minimum price they have determined.

  16. The Author can also invite future consumers to prepay to the designated wallet.

  17. A consumer can make a prepayment at the minimum set price. In the event that a percentage of the transaction is specified, the minimum amount that can be paid is not determined. If the selected model is payment per copy per month, the minimum price for one month is determined. The consumer can make a large prepayment, and if they do not use the product for all or part of this amount, after the project is launched and the amount of the Contributor's contribution is covered, they can request a portion of the invested amount to be refunded, and payments from new consumers will first of all cover this refund.

  **Branches**

  18. Any branch of the project can get its own independent life. This is especially likely if the changes proposed in the branch are not added to the master branch, or if changes are added to the master branch that cause doubt in some potential consumers. In this case, the wallet specified for payment for the work of the first commit in the branch can be used to pay for a copy created later within the branch. The author of the commit manages the wallet (although in the future we are counting on the emergence of an infrastructure that would automate the work of wallets used for such projects).

  19. Accordingly, the Author does not reserve the right to limit product changes within any branches (or individual projects incorporating this product), and the use of products derived from these branches. However, all branches when requiring payment for products created in them, will include the corresponding amount of the unpaid work of the Contributors of included into master branch commits.

  20. The branches inherit the minimum price specified in the parent branch. Let's imagine that branch B is inherited from the master branch, and branch C is further inherited from B. If the author of branch A has indicated a "minimum price" and if the sum specified by all of A’s Contributors is not yet covered, then the "minimum price" in branch A is inherited by the sales of branch B’s product, and from each sold copy of B this minimum amount goes to cover the contribution of participants in branch A (per their contribution). The author of branch B can specify an additional minimum price, which will also be used until the additional contribution of all Contributors to branch B is covered. Both these amounts will be taken into account when determining the "minimum price" of the product created in branch C.

  21. For the sake of convenience, a new product based on other products can be created not in the form of a branch, but in the form of a separate Github project, which links to the relevant source projects. In this case, it is obligatory to mention the Author, as well as other Contributors in accordance with the terms of their mention indicated in the description of the project. Also, there must be indication of the version of the branch and the wallet of the original branch, as well as the pricing rules and the distribution of money of the original project.

  22. The author of the master or new branch determines the rules by which the names of the Contributors will be mentioned: whether they are all mentioned, or top 10 by contribution, or any other principle. A rule can also be set for the mention of consumers (by order of involvement, or by the size of their investment before the launch, or any other principle).

## Development of the principals and tools.

Based on the principles described herein, the creation of tools will be launched within individual Github projects, that will allow more efficient conduct of projects on the principles described here. Various projects for the first products to be distributed under the **Coopyright License** will also be launched as separate Github projects.

**Issue:** [Insert a list of tools that need to be created for more effective work with **Coopyright Projects**: Payment system - cryptocurrency, taking into account the features of **Coopyright Projects**, System of voting for pull requests, et al.]

The cost of all the work to create these principles will be collected in [cost.md](cost.md). Each pull request to the master branch of this project should contain changes to this file with the addition of the cost of the work that the author of the changes within this pull request wants to include.  In the following format:

    First commit cost:** 8 hours х 3 ETH (attach confirmation of payment for the authors’ time by Snap Inc).
